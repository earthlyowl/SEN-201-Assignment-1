Project Overview



The Todo List Manager is a simple command-line application developed using Python. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete daily tasks. The project was chosen because it is simple, practical, and clearly demonstrates all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

SDLC Phases Applied to the Project



1\. Requirements Analysis



At this stage, the problem was clearly identified.



Functional Requirements:



User should be able to add a new task



User should be able to view all tasks



User should be able to update a task



User should be able to delete a task



Tasks should be saved in a file





Non‑Functional Requirements:



Application should be simple and easy to use



Program should run on the command line



Code should be readable and well‑structured

2\. System Design



The system was designed as a CLI-based application.



Design Components:



Task → represents a single todo item



TodoManager → handles task operations (add, view, update, delete)



main() → controls program flow and user interaction





Data Storage:



Tasks are stored in a text file (tasks.txt)







---



3\. Implementation



The system was implemented using Python.



Key implementation files:



todo.py → main application logic



tasks.txt → stores saved tasks





All names and classes used in the design were maintained in the implementation.





---



4\. Testing



The application was tested using manual testing:



Added multiple tasks



Updated existing tasks



Deleted tasks



Checked file persistence





Each function was tested to ensure it behaves as expected.

5\. Deployment



The project can be deployed by:



1\. Installing Python





2\. Cloning the GitHub repository





3\. Running the application using:



python todo.py









---



6\. Maintenance



Possible future improvements include:



Adding task priority levels



Adding due dates



Creating a GUI version
